# shellpipes

An R package for working through Makefile and command lines. Designed to be used with [makestuff](https://github.com/dushoff/makestuff) and specifically with [pipeR.mk](https://github.com/dushoff/makestuff/blob/master/pipeR.mk).

The shellpipes code is in the [backend of this repo](https://github.com/dushoff/shellpipes)

## Installation

From inside R:

```r
remotes::install_github("dushoff/shellpipes")
```

This will fail for old versions of `remotes` (before 2.2.0), because the default branch is now "main" instead of "master". Adding `, ref="main"` before the last paren may well fix this problem, but you should probably update `remotes` instead:

`install.packages("remotes")`

… and then try again

_Alternative_ If you can't `install_github` because of permission problems, try:

* [download this zip file](https://github.com/dushoff/shellpipes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* unzip it
* `R CMD INSTALL shellpipes-main` from the directory where you unzipped.

## Overview

shellpipes is designed to:
* make working with makestuff pipelines easy and transparent
* make it relatively easy to use the same script both in a make pipeline and interactively

shellpipes functions work with a list of filenames that can be specified manually, but is typically specified by either:
* command-line arguments that include the word `shellpipes`
	* these are usually passed by make
* an `rpcall()` command
	* this command is often auto-generated by make and pasted into the script
	* the `rpcall()` is ignored if the command-line argument `shellpipes` is present

The idea is that shellpipes expects to _read_ from files in the filename list, and to _write_ to files with the same basename as the target. `pipeR.mk` recognizes that `.Rout` files are made using a shellpipe-friendly call, and that `.rda`, `.rds`, `.Rout.*` and other sorts of files are made as side-effects of `.Rout`.

A few example functions are listed below. Please see documentation from installed package (BB: feel free to tell me what's the recommended way to put documentation online).

### Setup

``` R
library(shellpipes) ## to load the package
startGraphics() ## not strictly necessary, but good practice; can also be used to set height and width
## startGraphics() does not do anything in interactive mode unless you over-ride a switch; it's meant to play nicely with interactive users
```

### Reading files

* `loadEnvironments()` loads all environments (typically saved as `.rda`) from the filename list sequentially into the global environment; `getEnvironment()` and `loadEnvironmentList()` allow you to manipulate environments separately
* `rdsRead()` returns a single serialized object (typically saved as `.rds`) from the filename list; you can use pattern matching to select if necessary
* `csvRead()` reads a matched csv file using `read_csv()`

### Saving files

* `saveEnvironment()` saves the whole global environment as an `.rda` (using the target name as a base by default)
* `saveVars()` saves selected variables to an `.rda`
* `rdsSave()` saves a single selected variable to an `.rds`
