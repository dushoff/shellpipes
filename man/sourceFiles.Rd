\title{Source certain files from a file list
Usually we are inside the first .R file so we want to source the others (first=FALSE by default)
If called from a wrapper, we probably want to source the main source file (first in list) _last_.
Other styles of calling need to be done in a clunky, manual fashion; I've never needed to do this
first is for when the calling script is some sort of wrapper for the pipeline; should not be needed for pure pipeR projects}
